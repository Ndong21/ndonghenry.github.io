# Call for Mentors — Join the Mission
As we start this new chapter, we’re opening doors to mentors who want to help us make a difference.

If you want to help young talents find direction in their careers, this is your opportunity.

This time around, because we understand what much favor you do for us as a mentor, the 1-1 sessions are now slated for once every two weeks.

Some Mentor Responsibilities Include:

* Provide guidance and feedback to trainees throughout the six-month program.
* Share insights on real-world challenges and how to approach them.
* Join bi-weekly check-ins to monitor progress, review deliverables, and answer questions.

# Looking Ahead
This program has grown stronger with every edition because of the people behind it, mentors, partners, and friends who believe in the power of shared growth.

We can’t wait to see what we’ll build together next.

# Want to Mentor or Collaborate?
